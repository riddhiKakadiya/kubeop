# AWS S3 Folder Service Operator

Operators are pieces of software that ease the operational complexity of running another piece of software. More technically, Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application.

The AWS Folder Service Operator provides an extension to AWS S3 bucket service
that automates creation of self healing S3 folder for a given user.
A Chart release is described through a Kubernetes custom resource named team2-kubeop-helmchart. 

## AWS S3 Folder Service Operator features

* Creates IAM User
* Creates Bucket with the folder named after the user's username
* Create a bucket policy restricting access of the user to their own folder and binding user and bucker folder
* Secret of the IAM user is stored in user defined IAM secret name
* Self healing for deleted IAM secret (Event driven)
* Self AWS resources (Time driven)
